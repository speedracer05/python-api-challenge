# Introduction

This repository is an assignment from UC Davis's Data Analytics bootcamp. The purpose of this two-part excercise. Part I, WeatherPy, is to visualize the weather of 500+ cities, across the world of varying distances from the equator, retrieveing data from the OpenWehaterMap API. In Part II, VactionPy, builds upon data acquired from Part I to plan a future vacation, and using jupyter-maps and Goolge Places API to displaying humidity information on a heat map, find ideal weather conditions and select a hotel for each city within 5000 meters of the selected coordinates, then plotting hotels with the hotel name, city and country.
